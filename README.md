# VPN Client - Android MVP

A native Android VPN client demonstrating Clean Architecture, modern Android development practices, and comprehensive testing. Built with Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, and Hilt for dependency injection.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

This project follows **Clean Architecture** principles with clear separation of concerns:

```
app/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ presentation/     # UI Layer (Compose, ViewModels)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ domain/          # Business Logic (Use Cases, Models, Interfaces)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data/            # Data Layer (Repositories, APIs, DataStore)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ di/              # Dependency Injection (Hilt Modules)
```

### Key Architectural Patterns

- **Clean Architecture**: Separation of presentation, domain, and data layers
- **MVVM**: Model-View-ViewModel pattern with Compose
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstraction of data sources
- **State Pattern**: Connection lifecycle management
- **Strategy Pattern**: Multiple connection strategies (Fast vs Secure)
- **Dependency Injection**: Hilt for IoC container

### Technology Stack

- **Language**: Kotlin 100%
- **UI Framework**: Jetpack Compose with Material 3
- **Architecture Components**: ViewModel, Navigation, DataStore

```

### 5. Install APK

```bash
./gradlew installDebug
```

# With coverage report
./gradlew testDebugUnitTestCoverage
```

## üîß Mock API Structure

The json-server provides these endpoints:

  {
    "id": 1,
    "email": "test@vpn.com",
    "password": "password123",
    "token": "mock_jwt_token_12345"

]
```

### VPN Nodes

```http
GET /api/v1/nodes
```

### AI-Generated Code Example

Here's an example of AI-generated code with a deliberate bug and its fix:

**Original AI-Generated Code (with bug)**:

```kotlin
// ‚ùå PROBLEMATIC: Using GlobalScope instead of viewModelScope
class AuthViewModel @Inject constructor(
    private val loginUseCase: LoginUseCase
) : ViewModel() {

    fun login(email: String, password: String) {
        GlobalScope.launch { // ‚ùå BUG: Memory leak potential
            loginUseCase(email, password)
                .onSuccess { user ->
                    _uiState.value = _uiState.value.copy(isAuthenticated = true)
                }
        }
    }
}
```

**Fixed Version**:

```kotlin
// ‚úÖ CORRECT: Using viewModelScope for proper lifecycle management
class AuthViewModel @Inject constructor(
    private val loginUseCase: LoginUseCase
) : ViewModel() {

    fun login(email: String, password: String) {
        viewModelScope.launch { // ‚úÖ FIX: Proper scope management
            loginUseCase(email, password)
                .onSuccess { user ->
                    _uiState.value = _uiState.value.copy(isAuthenticated = true)
                }
        }
    }
}
```

**Bug Explanation**:
The original code used `GlobalScope.launch` which can cause memory leaks because the coroutine isn't tied to the ViewModel's lifecycle. If the ViewModel is destroyed while the coroutine is running, it continues executing and may try to update UI state on a destroyed component.

**Fix Explanation**:
Using `viewModelScope.launch` ensures the coroutine is automatically cancelled when the ViewModel is cleared, preventing memory leaks and crashes. This is the recommended pattern for ViewModel coroutines in Android.
